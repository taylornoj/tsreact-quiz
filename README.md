I am currently teaching myself TypeScript, so decided to follow along with Thomas Weibenfalk's tutorial for this project. His Youtube Channel can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/weibenfalk

The Trivia API is from: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

As stretch work, I added the 'New Quiz' card which allows users to select the number of questions they wish to answer, along with choose a category and difficulty level.  I also added the flickering 'Game Over' text to add an arcade type feel to the game.

In the future I plan to modify the frontend further for a cleaner UI, and display all questions answered at the end of a game.
